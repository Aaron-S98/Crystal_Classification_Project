# Computational_Recognition_of_Crystalline_Environments

This is the GitHub repositry for all the python programs and jupyter notebooks used in this project. The aim of this project was to find a faster method of classifying atoms than the established Ten Wolde method, without sacrificing accuracy. 

Each version of the Python implementation Ten Wolde algorithm can be found in the Ten Wolde Algorithm Folder. For the code used to produce the Mayavi visualisations, see Mayavi folder. 

The Alternate descriptor folder details the programs used to generate each of the descriptors used in the neural network. For the python programs used to make SOAP descriptors for both close-packed Ar and Binary GeTe, see SOAP sub folder. The code used to convert each descriptor to binary form their Python outputs is in the Txt_to_Npy subfolder. 

The Germainium Telluride Folder details the programs used to produce the SOAP descriptors specifically for the GeTe structures. For each neural network used, a juypter notebook is in the 'Neural Network Juypter Notebook' folder.
